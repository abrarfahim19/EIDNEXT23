Linters and formatters are both tools used in software development to improve code quality and maintainability, but they serve different purposes and have distinct functionalities.

## Linter:
A linter is a static code analysis tool that scans source code for potential errors, coding style violations, and other issues. It analyzes the code without executing it, identifying common mistakes and providing suggestions for improvement. Linters enforce coding standards and help developers follow best practices in their code. They can catch syntax errors, variable misuse, unused code, and other common programming mistakes.
For example, a linter might flag the following issues in a codebase:

Using undefined variables or functions.
Writing code that violates a specified coding style (indentation, naming conventions, etc.).
Using deprecated or unsafe language features.
Popular linters for various programming languages include ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python, and RuboCop for Ruby.

## Formatter:
A formatter, on the other hand, is a tool that automatically formats code to adhere to a consistent style, as defined by a coding style guide. Formatters do not analyze the code for potential issues but focus solely on the code's layout and formatting. They can automatically adjust the indentation, spacing, line breaks, and other formatting aspects of the code to ensure it follows the prescribed style.
For example, a formatter might automatically reformat the following code snippet to adhere to a specific coding style:

```python
sum(a,b):
return a+b
```

Formatted using a Python formatter:

```python
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b
```
Popular formatters include Prettier for JavaScript, Black for Python, and gofmt for Go.

In summary, linters focus on analyzing code for errors, potential issues, and adherence to coding standards, while formatters concentrate on automatically adjusting code layout and formatting to conform to a specified style guide. Both tools are valuable for maintaining clean, consistent, and high-quality codebases. Using both linters and formatters together can significantly improve code readability, maintainability, and collaboration in software development projects.

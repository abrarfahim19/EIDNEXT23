## What is TDD?
TDD stands for Test-Driven Development.
It is a software development approach where tests are written before writing the actual code.
The process involves writing a failing test, writing the code to pass the test, and then refactoring as necessary.

## Classic Testing
Some of the classic testings are:
1. Unit Testing: Write at individual function level
2. Integration Testing: Write to see if the component works 
3. End to End Testing: Write to see end result from end users perspective tests

There are other testings like:
1. Acceptance Testing: Validate business logic
2. System Testing: Validate if that works on real hardware
3. SMOKE testing: Validate if the essential components works before production
